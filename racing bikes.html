<h1>racing bike</h1>
<P>racing bike, also known as a road bike or road-racing bicycle, is designed for speed and efficiency on paved surfaces. They feature lightweight frames, narrow tires, dropped handlebars, and high-performance components like derailleurs gears and disc brakes. Race bikes are optimized for aerodynamic performance and allow the rider to achieve a low, aerodynamic position for maximum speed. </P>
